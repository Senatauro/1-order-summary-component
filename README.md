## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This exercise was great for me to keep training my skills in React. The more I do this, the more I feel like I'm building my skills that I can use in the future.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I want to keep improving my skills in React. Right now I'm a beginner in frontend development but have a lot of skills in other areas that I'm porting to my frontend learning. I'm sure that with my continuous learning, I'll be able to build a better portfolio and be more effective in my field and get a good job.

### Useful resources
